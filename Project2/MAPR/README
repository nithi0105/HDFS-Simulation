Config files: 

dn_config.txt: 
Format of entries is: Name;IP;Port (separated by semi-colons and no spaces in between)
- For now we only have it working with one Datanode in the config file

nn_config.txt:
Format of entries is: Name;IP;Port (separated by semi-colons and no spaces in between)
- In the java files, we have default set the name of NameNode as "INameNode" so the name in the config file does not matter

config.properties: all the configurable entities that include heart beat interval, block size in bytes, replication factor, and block report interval
- only the numbers need to be changed
